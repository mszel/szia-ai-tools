# Example Notebooks and Applications

This folder contains tutorial notebooks and full-stack applications (using Streamlit and FastAPI) that demonstrate how to use the **szia-ai-tools** library.
Each subfolder includes either a `README.md` with instructions or self-explanatory notebooks with inline guidance.

The following examples are currently available (and the list is continuously expanding):
